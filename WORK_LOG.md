The main idea proposed was to use a an array of the hashes of the given keys. In this array there would be arraylists in each index and if there was a collision the hashes of the keys would be added to the same location in the array and stored in the array list. |

Once a prime was chosen I added a hash function to hash the given strs. I also added an array of arraylist to act as our hash table. |
| Nov 3   | 9:45- 10:15 am | I tried adding hashes of each line to the hashtable. I do not know if the readline function goes to the next line automatically so it may just be adding the same line at the moment. If it doesn't I will need to find a way ot get to the next line then the code should add the hash of it to an arraylist with its index in the array of arraylist being based on its hash. I do not know how we would discern which hash is which during collision so that is what I will have to figure out next if the current code works. |


To add a new row to the table, click into a cell and then hit shift-enter.
