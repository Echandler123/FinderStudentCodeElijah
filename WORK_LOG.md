| Oct 29  |      9-10am      |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       In class discussion. The main idea proposed was to use a an array of the hashes of the given keys. In this array there would be arraylists in each index and if there was a collision the hashes of the keys would be added to the same location in the array and stored in the array list. |
| Oct 31  |  10:50-11:50 am  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Another in class discussion to try and find the most ideal prime number to use. Once a prime was chosen I added a hash function to hash the given strs. I also added an array of arraylist to act as our hash table. |
| Nov 3   |  9:45- 10:15 am  | I tried adding hashes of each line to the hashtable. I do not know if the readline function goes to the next line automatically so it may just be adding the same line at the moment. If it doesn't I will need to find a way ot get to the next line then the code should add the hash of it to an arraylist with its index in the array of arraylist being based on its hash. I do not know how we would discern which hash is which during collision so that is what I will have to figure out next if the current code works. |
| Nov 5   |  2:00 - 3:00 pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           I created a hashmap class and made some getter and setter methods for it. I also added some instance variables to the hashmap class. I start the constructor but I haven ot finished it. I tried making a while loop that goes until every line is read but I know it doesn't work yet. |

I laos moved the hash function over to the Hashmap as it is only need there and also edited it to modulus by the table size and not a large prime number. I finished the resize method but I have not figure out the get and add methods yet which is what I am going to do next. |

I also finished the finder class but have now tested and found that there is an null pointer but I have not found out hat is causing it yet. |
| Nov 11  |  2:30 - 2:30 pm  |                                                                   I fixed the null pointer error by doing modulus on the hash value one more time by the table size. I also had some variables as instance variables which caused them to never reset when I needed them to so I fixed that. I was still always getting invalid key as the answer so I checked my add and get methods and my collisions checks and linear probing was incorrect for that but once I fixed that the coded worked. I just have to add comments now. |
