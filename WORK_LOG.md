| Oct 29  |   9-10am    | In class discussion. The main idea proposed was to use a an array of the hashes of the given keys. In this array there would be arraylists in each index and if there was a collision the hashes of the keys would be added to the same location in the array and stored in the array list. |
| Oct 31  | 10:50-11:50 |                                                                        Another in class discussion to try and find the most ideal prime number to use. Once a prime was chosen I added a hash function to hash the given strs. I also added an array of arraylist to act as our hash table. |
